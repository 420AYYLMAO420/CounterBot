# CounterBot
If you ever need to spam the numbers 69-420 to a channel

For the .py file to work, you will need a Discord profile, a Discord application, a Discord bot(that's right, get your own token), Python 3.5.3 or higher(2.7 will not work, see [prerequisites](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#prerequisites)), and discord.py(which is just an installable module).

In the Main.py file, you will need to replace the 'insert token here' string with the token of the bot. Make sure that it is in quotes(ex: '938381hdohwoganawio_3084023j').
